#intro
Hello- and welcome to our team's project. mAUTHra! A program that helps its user to identify threat actors by demonstrating who is logging on to their network. All wrapped up in an easy to use and read format.  
#set up scenerio/user
Follow along with us during this scenerio if you will. Our security analyst "Akira" is at work and having a couple of users on here team complaining of their computers running slowly or not working at all. She has checked the network and knows it is not a connection issue. 
Her next thought is every data security professionals worst nightmare. "What if its a an outside security threat on our network!" The clock is ticking and her boss wants to know why business is running so slowly. As a data analyst it is her duty to parse through the logs of her network to check for nefarious activities. At this point business is being affected, so the faster the better.
Further, if she does find any log data that hints to this, she will have to make a report to present to her boss and incident response team. Sure she could check her firewall and ids logs, or run a scan to check for any payloads. But what if she wanted to dig a little deeper and see if an attacker was able to gain access to her network, or gained the ability to install a back door? Now would be the perfect time for her to utilize mAUTHra! With this vital tool she will be able to parse through multiple logs and see if anyone has; created or deleted new users, changed any passwords, tried to change roots password, any failed sudo commands, failed root logins, and SSH logins. The best part is that this is all done for her instantly, and even provides usable and readable data in real time. Here you can see that mAUTHra offers the option to check for any if these tests by simply pressings a few button prompts. Well what if you want to see everything? mAUTHra has that feature as well! Just select that "ALL" option in the main menu and mAUTHra provides all of this data for you in an organized fashion. You can have this "mini report" ready before your boss even has time to walk over to your desk. I'm sure you are asking yourself-" What if i want to save this data to add to an official report?" mAUTHra has an answer for that! When running a query you have the option to export this data into a new or appendable file. That way you can reference again, or with the append option, create a network history that expands well beyond the default linux configurations. This is useful in detecting beaconing activity or if an attacker is executing multiple payloads after working hours. By creating a log data history it is much easier to see common, and uncommon network behavior. Finally, what if Akira wants to present this data to a non technical person, or view large sums of data (such as data historcals) in a more user-friendly way? Well we aren't finished yet! We have programed mAUTHra to have to ability to view data in an easy to read graph. By utilizing this option is is easy to demonstrate spikes in authorization activities within your network in a way that anyone can easily interpret. 
#Conclusion 
In closing, mAUTHra can be added into anyone's arsenal as a very powerful tool. Weather the user simple wants to save time when detecting certain spikes in activity or needs to identify where an attacker has gained access too. mAUThra can identify what an attacker has tried- and what they have done. It can help flesh out an incident report, and even show trends in network history. Tied together in a simple and easy to use interface.
