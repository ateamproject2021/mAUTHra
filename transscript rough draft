Hello everyone! We are excited to introduce to you... project mAUTHra! mAUTHra is a program that can quickly and easily identify malicious actors or activities by parsing Linux log files that are fed to it. Simply git clone mAUTHra to a host machine and you can be parsing your logs in seconds. 

mAUTHra is a tool that any network professional can utilize. At its core, mAUTHra is a Linux log scraping python program that has the capability to find: created or deleted new users, any password changes, failed password authentications, sudo commands, SSH logins, and even installed programs on the host machine. The user not only has the option to run a query for any of these parameters individually, but can also run all of these at the same time with mAUThra's "ALL" feature!
The output offers a much larger review of what is happening when anyone is accessing your network. This is especially helpful because the user can review who has logged in from inside and outside of the network, without having to parse through these logs in their entirety. Everything you would need to know is displayed for you in a fraction of the time.

Follow along with us for this scenario. Our data analyst 'Nick' (Mathew Broderick reference from the 1998 film, we can include his pic for laughs), exhausted from a long week of tracking a recent actor attempting to gain access to his network (gojira), receives an internal complaint about odd activity on a user’s host machine (Cyan). Has his network actually been compromised? On a Friday afternoon? Really? 

He knows that this requires further investigation. If possible, he needs some high-level information in a hurry for his team to begin their investigation. So, Nick makes himself a cup of coffee and rolls up his sleeves. This is shaping up to be a long afternoon. Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees his security team lead heading towards his office.

At this point, Nick needs information in a hurry! With mere moments to spare, he has to come up with something, and fast! Luckily for Nick, he finds mAUTHra! It downloads in mere seconds with a simple git clone command from his terminal, and with a simple file path input, BOOM, he instantly parses his auth logs with the “All” command, and data is available for him to review. This data will give his team a head start to their investigation, allowing Nick to enjoy some well-deserved rest this weekend!

In conclusion, mAUThra has many capabilities that the user can utilize. From something small like checking to see how many attempts someone in accounting took to remember their password, all the way to parsing dpkg logs for newly installed programs, mAUTHra can provide an easy, fast way to give the analyst the data they need to begin an investigation. If you need log information in a hurry, we would love for you to try “mAUTHra.”
“Provide git hub address, as well as instructions to git clone the path from Linux terminal. Mention that if you have any questions, simply refer to the github READme for more information.”

We also obviously need to decide how this will be split, as well as write in the transition lines as we transition from person to person.

Hey guys, ive made a newer version! My idea is that while the demo itelf isnt very long( ive viewed other videos and their demo is only a fraction of their video) i am confident that this is a good direction. The placements of speakers can be changed as well i just put it in as a place holder. I think that this places us in a much better light with our efforts being the main forcus. I have a ton of ideas on visuals so trust me that it will not get stale while we are talking through the technical parts. If i have typed anything inacurate or if you have any edits please feel free to do so. 

Matthew:
Hello and welcome everyone. Our project is titled mAUTHra! A program for scraping logs. But before we get into it I would like to introduce everyone. Our team is comprised of myself, Matthew Landry, we also have Joshua Gregoir, Stephen Koplik and Phillip Trimble. We’ve all worked together to create this project that we hope you will enjoy.
At its core mAUTHra is a program that parses through syslogs for relevant information. If you’ve ever accessed a syslog or any other log, you know that they are filled to the brim with information about your computer. Sometimes this information is very helpful, and sometimes it isn’t. We’ve decided to write a program that can aid in your search. To tell you a little more about it we have Stephan
Stephan: 
Hello (intro sentence). mAUTHra was built utilizing the power of python! mAUTHra is able to go through these logs for you and only output the information that you have searched for. We’ve designed it to read the log that you provide, and search for key terms that we think could be useful. For example. One of our parameters is failed passwords. We’ve written a module that accesses the auth log in Linux and and then prints only the lines that contain the phrase “failed password”. So the user instead of having to read through the entire log can simply have it outputted for them. We’ve used this pattern and programmed mAUTHra to be able to search for many criteria based on your inquiry. These include: failed password authentications as mentioned earlier but also; created or deleted new users, any password changes, sudo commands, SSH logins, and even installed programs on the host machine. That way with the touch of a few buttons the user can get a really good idea of what is happening on their network with minimal effort. We thought not only could this be very handy but sticking with the theme of auth gave us the opportunity to show a user a really all encompassing idea of who is attempting to access their network. To further explain how this can be optimized in a real world setting we will have Joshua assist us.
Josh: 
(intro snetence) To better demomnstrate how we can use mAUTHra in an everyday setting lets go through a scenerio. So we have our data analyst 'Nick'. He is exhausted from a long week of tracking a recent threat attempting to gain access to his network.  Then he receives an internal complaint about odd activity on a user’s host machine (Cyan). Has his network actually been compromised? On a Friday afternoon? Really? 
He knows that this requires further investigation. He knows that if this was a normal attack vector his Firewall or IDS would have alerted him. If possible, he needs some high-level information and in a hurry for his team to begin their investigation. So, Nick makes himself a cup of coffee and rolls up his sleeves. This is shaping up to be a long afternoon. But just then, 
out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees his security team lead heading towards his office. This doesnt look good. For a demonstaration and to see how Nick conquers this delima, we have Phillip to show us.

Here you can see we have designed mAUTHra to be able to search for many different parameters. Much of this information is relevant and instead of reading each log line by line, we have programmed mAUTHra to do all the heavy lifting for you!
At this point, Nick needs information and in a hurry! With mere moments to spare, he has to come up with something, and fast! Luckily for Nick, he has mAUTHra! It downloads in seconds with a git clone command from his terminal, and with a simple file path input, BOOM, he instantly parses his auth logs with the “All” command. The data is now available for him to review. This data will give his team a head start to their investigation, allowing Nick to enjoy some well-deserved rest this weekend, all while impressing his boss and colegues. 

To conclude: mAUTHra has many capabilities that any user can utilize. We have designed it to be useful in small efforts like determining who in accounting keeps forgetting their passwords, all the way to parsing dpkg logs for newly installed programs with malicious payloads. Our idea was to build a tool that any analyst can have in their arsenal, and use efficiently. It takes a closer look at who has access, and who is trying to gain access to your network, and what they are trying to do. We hope that you have enjoyed our presentation and that you can see the same value in mAUTHra that we do. Thank you
