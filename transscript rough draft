Hello everyone! We are excited to introduce to you... project mAUTHra! mAUTHra is a program that can quickly and easily identify malicious actors or activities by parsing Linux log files that are fed to it. Simply git clone mAUTHra to a host machine and you can be parsing your logs in seconds. 
mAUTHra is a tool that any network professional can utilize. At its core, mAUTHra is a Linux log scraping python program that has the capability to find: created or deleted new users, any password changes, failed password authentications, sudo commands, SSH logins, and even installed programs on the host machine. The user not only has the option to run a query for any of these parameters individually, but can also run all of these at the same time with mAUThra's "ALL" feature! 

This can offer a much larger review of what is happening when anyone is accessing your network. This is especially helpful because the user can review who has logged in from inside and outside of the network, without having to parse through these logs in their entirety. Everything you would need to know is displayed for you in a fraction of the time. 
Follow along with us for this scenario. Our data analyst 'Nick' (Mathew Broderick reference from the 1998 film, we can include his pic for laughs) is having a normal and productive day at work, when he receives an internal complaint about odd activity on a user’s host machine. What if our network has been compromised? 
He knows that this requires further investigation. If possible, he needs some high-level information in a hurry to begin his investigation. So, Nick makes himself a cup of coffee and rolls up his sleeves. This is shaping up to be a long afternoon. Then- from down the hall- he can see his security manager navigating the cubicles, making his way towards him, like Godzilla making his way through New York!
Made aware of the situation, Nick’s boss needs some information in a hurry. With mere moments to spare, Nick has to think of something fast! Luckily for Nick, he recently git cloned a copy of mAUTHra. It downloads in mere seconds, and with a simple file path input, BOOM, he instantly parses his auth logs with the “All” command, and data is available for him to review.


In conclusion, mAUThra has many capabilities that the user can utilize. From something small like checking to see how many attempts someone in accounting took to remember their password, all the way to parsing dpkg logs for newly installed programs, mAUTHra can provide an easy, fast way to give the analyst the data they need to begin an investigation. If you need log information in a hurry, we would love for you to try “mAUTHra.”
“Provide git hub address, as well as instructions to git clone the path from Linux terminal. Mention that if you have any questions, simply refer to the github READme for more information.”
We also obviously need to decide how this will be split, as well as write in the transition lines as we transition from person to person.
