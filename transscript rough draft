#intro
Hello- and welcome to our team's project. mAUTHra! A program that helps its user to identify threat actors by demonstrating who is logging on to their network. All wrapped up in an easy to use and read format.  
#demo 

#set up scenerio/user
Follow along with us during this scenerio if you will. Our security analyst "Akira" is at work and having a couple of users on here team complaining of their computers running slowly or not working at all. She has checked the network and knows it is not a connection issue. 
Her next thought is every data security professionals worst nightmare. "What if its a an outside security threat on our network!" The clock is ticking and her boss wants to know why business is running so slowly. As a data analyst it is her duty to parse through the logs of her network to check for nefarious activities. At this point business is being affected, so the faster the better.
Further, if she does find any log data that hints to this, she will have to make a report to present to her boss and incident response team. Sure she could check her firewall and ids logs, or run a scan to check for any payloads. But what if she wanted to dig a little deeper and see if an attacker was able to gain access to her network, or gained the ability to install a back door? Now would be the perfect time for her to utilize mAUTHra! With this vital tool she will be able to parse through multiple logs and see if anyone has; created or deleted new users, changed any passwords, tried to change roots password, any failed sudo commands, failed root logins, and SSH logins. The best part is that this is all done for her instantly, and even provides usable and readable data in real time. Here you can see that mAUTHra offers the option to check for any if these tests by simply pressings a few button prompts. Well what if you want to see everything? mAUTHra has that feature as well! Just select that "ALL" option in the main menu and mAUTHra provides all of this data for you in an organized fashion. You can have this "mini report" ready before your boss even has time to walk over to your desk. I'm sure you are asking yourself-" What if i want to save this data to add to an official report?" mAUTHra has an answer for that! When running a query you have the option to export this data into a new or appendable file. That way you can reference again, or with the append option, create a network history that expands well beyond the default linux configurations. This is useful in detecting beaconing activity or if an attacker is executing multiple payloads after working hours. By creating a log data history it is much easier to see common, and uncommon network behavior. Finally, what if Akira wants to present this data to a non technical person, or view large sums of data (such as data historcals) in a more user-friendly way? Well we aren't finished yet! We have programed mAUTHra to have to ability to view data in an easy to read graph. By utilizing this option is is easy to demonstrate spikes in authorization activities within your network in a way that anyone can easily interpret. 
#Conclusion 
In closing, mAUTHra can be added into anyone's arsenal as a very powerful tool. Weather the user simple wants to save time when detecting certain spikes in activity or needs to identify where an attacker has gained access too. mAUThra can identify what an attacker has tried- and what they have done. It can help flesh out an incident report, and even show trends in network history. Tied together in a simple and easy to use interface.   



NEWER VERSION STILL ROUGH 

Hello everyone! Welcocme to to the A-teams final project. Project mAUTHra! A program for data analyst to identify threat actors, by demonstarating who is logging on to their network. Executed on a host machine, and wrapped up in an easy-to-use format. 
mAUTHra is a tool that any network professional can utalize. At it's core mAUTHra is a log scraping  program that has the capabililty to find; created or deleted new users, any password changes, any attempted changes to root's password, any failed sudo commands, failed root logins, and SSH logins! All of this is done instantly and outputted in an easy to read format. The user has the option to run a queiry for any of these parameters so that the results are talored specificly for the analyst's needs. In addition, the user can instead run all of these at the same time with mAUThra's "ALL" feature! This can offer a much larger review of what is happening when anyone is accessing your network. This is especially helpful because the user can review who who has logged in from inside and outside of the network, without having to parse through these logs in their entirety. Everything you would need to know is displayed for you in a fraction of the time. Additionaly, the results can be written into a one time use file for reference, or an appendable file. Taking this one step farther, with the option to write to an appendable file, you can view the data's history that expands well beyond linux's default configurations. Using this you can detect if beaconing activity is being used, or if there are bandwidth spikes during non business hours. Being able to catalog all of these relevant information in a data historical can really give its user and all-encompassing view of whats happeneing on their network as far as who is allowed on it. /// To add the cherry on top, we have also programmed mAUTHra to have the ability to display this data to its user in a graph/chart. This can be ran against a one time queiry or those data historicals. That way the user can very easily interpret huge amounts of data and displpay it to a non-technical person or use it to flesh out a formal report.  
Follow along with us for this scenerio. Our data analyst 'Akira' is having a normal and productive day at work. Suddenly she starts recieving complaints that the network is running slowly or not at all. After checking in with the IT department, she has confirmed it is neither a connection nor a harware issue. Her next thought is every network security professional's worst nightmare. "What if our network has been compromised?" There are MANY MANY avenues that she has to follow up on to make sure that the security on her end has been covered. If this were any normal malicious actor her firewall or IDS system would have alerted her. She knows that this requiress further investigation. So she makes herself a cup of coffee and rolls up her sleeves. This is going to be a long afternoon but she is confident in her forensic capabilities. Then- from down the hall- she can see her security manager making his way towards her, with all the rage of GODZILLA! She just knows he is going to come in and chew her head off. Especially after she was late getting to work last week because the line at starbucks was too long. She has mere moments before he is at her door and she has to think of something fast! Luckily for her, her good friends at the A-team have just sent her the BETA of mAUTHra. She figures she has nothing to lose, so she fires it up. It loads in seconds and she selects the "ALL" funstions, then selects "YES" to the graphical option. BOOM she has multiple logs already parssed though, the data is already organized in an informal report she can hand off to the incident responce team, and the graph pops up so that she can explain what this data means to her boss. This was all completed in only the moments her boss took coming down the hall. Now when he enters her office it will seem as though she has been going through logs after logs all day. She kicks her feet up and takes a sip of her coffee. She knows that she will be able to go to starbucks again next week with no resistance.  
In conclusion, mAUThra has many capabilities that the user can utilize. From something small like checking if the alerts that they are  getting is just someone in accounting who forgot their password, all the way up to comparing historcal data to see what is usual and unusal on her network as a whole. It can be paired with seims or used as a basic siem itself. It takes the guest work out of the way for analyst, and steamlines one of the most important duties of an analyst- documentation and detection. We believe that in some form or another, anyone who cares about data security should have access to mAUTHra.

Please add to or append as you see fit. I am very open to making this funnier/lighter/ in some ways to keep non-tech people interest, or to ease the burden of our teachers and future employers bc they will be looking at ALOT of stuff.
