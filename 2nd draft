Matthew:

Hello and welcome to our presentation. Our project is titled mAUTHra, named after Godzilla's classic nemesis. A command line program, mAUTHra is designed to scrape Linux Authorization log files. I'd like to introduce the members of the team: I am Matthew Landry, we also have Joshua Gregoir, Stephen Koplik and Phillip Trimble. We’ve all worked together to create this useful project we hope you'll enjoy using.

At its core, mAUTHra is a program that parses through log files for information relevant to a test case selected as input. If you’ve ever accessed a syslog or any other log, you know that they are filled to the brim with information about your computer. Sometimes this information can be intuitively revealing, but just as often it can be overwhelming. We’ve decided to write a program that can aid in your search. To tell you a little more about how mAUTHra works, here's Stephen.

Stephen: 

Thanks Matthew. mAUTHra was built utilizing the power of Python! There's no need to generate your own search parameters as maAUTHra picks and chooses and chooses only the relevant information. mAUTHra features a suite of pre-made test cases to run against your log file. For example, say you wanted to check for instances of incorrect password input. We’ve written a module that accesses the auth log in Linux and and then prints only the lines that contain the phrase “failed password”. Instead of the user being forced to read through the entire log, output is simple to understand and instantaneously generated.

In addition to failed password attempts detection, you can also search for any creation or deletion of users, password changes, sudo usage, SSH logins, and even newly installed programs on the host machine. With the touch of a few buttons, the user can get an in-depth sense of what's happening on their machine with minimal effort. Sticking with the theme of authorization, the built-in tools allow an administrator to uncover any malicious activity relating to user accounts. To further explain how mAUTHra can be optimized in a real world setting we have Joshua to assist us.

Josh: 
Thank you Stephen. To better demomnstrate how we can use mAUTHra in an everyday setting lets go through a scenerio. We have our data analyst 'Nick'. He is exhausted from a long week of tracking a recent threat actor probing his network. Then he receives an internal complaint about odd activity on a user’s host machine (Cyan). Has his network actually been compromised on a Friday afternoon of all times? How inconvenient.

This requires further investigation. Nick knows that if this was a normal attack vector his Firewall or IDS would have alerted him. If possible, he needs some high-level information and in a hurry for his team to begin their investigation. So Nick makes himself a cup of coffee and rolls up his sleeves. This is shaping up to be a long afternoon. But just then Nick sees his security team lead heading towards his office. This doesnt look good. For a demonstaration and to see how Nick conquers this delima, we have Phillip to show us.

Phillip:
Thanks Joshua.

Nick boots up mAUTHra and is prompted with a selection screen. Good thing he can let the computer do the heavy lifting! Nick needs reliable information and in a hurry! Luckily for Nick, he has mAUTHra! It downloads in seconds with a simple git clone command from his terminal, and all it takes is a file path input. BOOM! Nick has instantly parsed his authorization logs with the “All” command from mAUTHra. The data is now available for him to review and will give his team a head start in their investigation. Now Nick can sleep easy knowing he's impressed his boss and collegues.

To conclude: mAUTHra has many capabilities that any user can utilize. We have designed it to be useful in small efforts like determining who in accounting keeps forgetting their passwords, all the way to parsing dpkg logs for newly installed programs with malicious payloads. Our idea was to build a tool that any analyst can have in their arsenal, and use efficiently. It takes a closer look at who has access, and who is trying to gain access to your network, and what they are trying to do. We hope that you have enjoyed our presentation and that you can see the same value in mAUTHra that we do. Thank you
